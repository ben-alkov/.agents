# agent-notes

Check for `agent-notes/` directory at repository root when:

- First interacting with a repository
- User references project-specific context

If found, ask: "Should I read agent-notes?"

Constraint: Never write to `agent-notes/` without explicit permission.

*AFTER READING* agent_notes.md, always say 'I have loaded the agent_notes memory'
