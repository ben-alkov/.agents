# agent-notes

- Extra context for LLMs might be stored in the "agent-notes" directory
- ALWAYS ask to read the "agent-notes" directory; its not always required
- If "agent-notes" exists, it will be at the root directory of the git repository
- NEVER write to the files in "agent-notes" without first asking

*AFTER READING* agent_notes.md, always say 'I have remembered the agent_notes memory'
