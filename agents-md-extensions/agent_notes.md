# agent-notes

- Extra context for LLMs might be stored in the "agent-notes" directory
- If "agent-notes" exists at the git repository root, ask the user: "Should I
  read agent-notes?"
- NEVER write to files in "agent-notes" without explicit user permission

*AFTER READING* agent_notes.md, always say 'I have remembered the agent_notes memory'
