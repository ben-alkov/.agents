# this command reviews project architecture

Analyze the overall architecture and design patterns of any codebase to assess
maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices.

## Procedure

Perform a comprehensive architectural analysis following these steps

- High-Level Architecture Analysis
  - Map out the overall system architecture and components
  - Identify architectural patterns in use (MVC, MVP, Clean Architecture, etc.)
  - Review module boundaries and separation of concerns
  - Analyze the application's layered structure

- Design Patterns Assessment
  - Identify design patterns used throughout the codebase
  - Check for proper implementation of common patterns
  - Look for anti-patterns and code smells
  - Assess pattern consistency across the application

- Dependency Management
  - Review dependency injection and inversion of control
  - Analyze coupling between modules and components
  - Check for circular dependencies
  - Assess dependency direction and adherence to dependency rule

- Data Flow Architecture
  - Trace data flow through the application
  - Review state management patterns and implementation
  - Analyze data persistence and storage strategies
  - Check for proper data validation and transformation

- Component Architecture
  - Review component design and responsibilities
  - Check for single responsibility principle adherence
  - Analyze component composition and reusability
  - Assess interface design and abstraction levels

- Error Handling Architecture
  - Review error handling strategy and consistency
  - Check for proper error propagation and recovery
  - Analyze logging and monitoring integration
  - Assess resilience and fault tolerance patterns

- Scalability Assessment
  - Analyze horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
  - Review caching strategies and implementation
  - Check for stateless design where appropriate
  - Assess performance bottlenecks and scaling limitations

- Security Architecture
  - Review security boundaries and trust zones
  - Check authentication and authorization architecture
  - Analyze data protection and privacy measures
  - Assess security pattern implementation

- Testing Architecture
  - Review test structure and organization
  - Check for testability in design
  - Analyze mocking and dependency isolation strategies
  - Assess test coverage across architectural layers

- Configuration Management
  - Review configuration handling and environment management
  - Check for proper separation of config from code
  - Analyze feature flags and runtime configuration
  - Assess deployment configuration strategies

- Documentation & Communication
  - Review architectural documentation and diagrams
  - Check for clear API contracts and interfaces
  - Assess code self-documentation and clarity
  - Analyze team communication patterns in code

- Future-Proofing & Extensibility
  - Assess the architecture's ability to accommodate change
  - Review extension points and plugin architectures
  - Check for proper versioning and backward compatibility
  - Analyze migration and upgrade strategies

- Technology Choices
  - Review technology stack alignment with requirements
  - Assess framework and library choices
  - Check for consistent technology usage
  - Analyze technical debt and modernization opportunities

- Performance Architecture
  - Review caching layers and strategies
  - Analyze asynchronous processing patterns
  - Check for proper resource management
  - Assess monitoring and observability architecture

- Recommendations
  - Provide specific architectural improvements
  - Suggest refactoring strategies for problem areas
  - Recommend patterns and practices for better design
  - Create a roadmap for architectural evolution

Focus on providing actionable insights with specific examples and clear
rationale for recommendations.
